## **Summary**

This week's lecture covered the basics of Earth Observation (EO) and Remote Sensing including topics such as definitions, relevance and terminology of Earth Observation, as well as more technical concepts to describe sensors (resolutions, types, interactions of light). In this summary, I'll focus on the latter, mainly defining some of the key characteristics of sensors (Image 1). To have a clearer understanding of these concepts, I will exemplify them with information from two of the main satellites discussed in class: Landsat and Sentinel (Image 2).

From this comparison, it's worth noticing that overall, Sentinel shows better characteristics, like spatial resolutions with more detail, more spectral bands and more frequent temporal resolution than Landsat. It would be interesting to see in which cases, despite having seemingly lower characteristics, Landsat imagery could represent a better tool to assess an spatial problem.

## **Applications**

Since this week's summary included a comparison between Landsat and Sentinel sensors, I considered relevant to read a paper that compares both satellites' imagery applied to analyse Burn Severity Mapping in Western North America. This paper by Howe et al (2022) analysed 26 fires in western North America, and found that "Sentinel generally performed as well or better than Landsat for four spectral indices of burn severity", also that Sentinel's finer spatial resolution helps to identify fine-scale fire effects and therefore has a more precise identification of spatial patterns of fires and burned areas.

On the other hand, the paper *"Analysis of urban heat islands with Landsat satellite images and GIS in Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan City"* (Kasniza et al., 2023) explored the evolution of heat islands and their relationship to land surface temperature in Kuala Lumpur using Landsat 8 imagery. Instead of focusing on the research details, I want to focus on the methodology, where they explained that Landsat 8 was chosen because it provides thermal data through Band 10: Thermal Infrared (which isn't available on Sentinel). This band was used alongside other bands like NDVI and NIR for the analysis.

## **Reflections**

After reviewing the main concepts of sensors and comparing Landsat and Sentinel satellites, it seemed that Sentinel has more advantages in terms of its various resolutions and some uses like burn mapping. However, after reviewing literature and considering the pros and cons of each, itâ€™s worth pointing out that Landsat is still highly relevant, especially to certain topics, for example when it comes to analyzing heat, thanks to its thermal bands. Also, since Sentinel is relatively new, if I were looking to analyze long-term trends, Landsat would probably be the best option, which is something to keep in mind for future projects. In general, the main reflection from this, would be that depending of the research we want to do, it's worth assessing which sensor would give us greater information, and looking for examples in previous research is a great tool for that.
