## **Summary**

This week's lecture covered the basics of Earth Observation (EO) and Remote Sensing including topics such as definitions, relevance and terminology of Earth Observation, as well as more technical concepts to describe sensors (resolutions, types, interactions of light). In this summary, I'll focus on the latter, mainly defining some of the key characteristics of sensors (Image 1). To have a clearer understanding of these concepts, I will exemplify them with information from two of the main satellites discussed in class: Landsat and Sentinel (Image 2).

From this comparison, it's worth noticing that overall, Sentinel shows better characteristics, like spatial resolutions with more detail, more spectral bands and more frequent temporal resolution than Landsat. It would be interesting to see in which cases, despite having seemingly lower characteristics, Landsat imagery could represent a better tool to assess an spatial problem.

## **Applications**

Since this week's summary included a comparison between Landsat and Sentinel sensors, I considered relevant to check literature that compares both satellites' imagery to evaluate what their main differences are and when could one of them be a better option than the other.

### Burn Severity Mapping in North America: comparing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2

This paper by [Howe et al (2022)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/20/5249) analysed 26 fires in western North America, and found that "Sentinel generally performed as well or better than Landsat for four spectral indices of burn severity", also that Sentinel's finer spatial resolution helps to identify fine-scale fire effects and therefore has a more precise identification of spatial patterns of fires and burned areas. One thing they mentioned is that Sentinel's finer spatial resolution (10m) led to a 5% reduction in high-severity patch interiors compared to Landsat 8 that has a resolution of 30m, that translated into almost 25 000 less mapped hectares. When I first saw the 5% reduction it seemed to me that it has not really a huge impact and that the differences were marginal but after seeing the real influence in area and also how evident it was visually, I understood that that kind of precision, even if little could make a great difference and that overall using Sentinel represents a huge improvement in the accuracy, at least for this kind of applications.

### Analysis of urban heat islands with Landsat satellite images and GIS in Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan City

While reviewing different papers I found it difficult to find one that when comparing both Landsat and Sentinel, opted to use the former. So instead, I decided to look for a paper that since the beginning decided to use it as part of its methodology(so it's not a comparison, but explains why they opted for this sensor). That's when I found this paper by [Kasniza et al (2023)](https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(23)05632-3) which explored the evolution of heat islands and their relationship to land surface temperature in Kuala Lumpur using Landsat 8 imagery. Instead of focusing on the research details, I want to focus on the methodology, where they explained that Landsat 8 was chosen because it provides thermal data through **Band 10: Thermal Infrared** (which isn't available on Sentinel), which was later used to calculate the Urban Heat Island index, alongside other bands like NIR.

*Image 4:* *Flowchart of the process of obtaining the urban heat indexes, showing which bands where used.*

After checking these two papers and also reviewing some others, I can tell that it's true that Sentinel 2 can be a great option(and very popular as well, maybe also because its newer?) because of its spatial and temporal resolution, for many types of applications that could be analysed with its available bands. But we can't generalize it as THE best option as, sometimes, like in the second paper, we might require some kind of information that only Landsat has, like in this case Thermal Infrared.

## **Reflections**

This week I learnt a lot of the foundations behind sensors which I actually didn't expected(I thought we would focus more directly on applications of satellite data) but I found interesting to get a grasp on what's actually going behind the images we see. Having an architecture background, I have previously used Satellite Images and I have "modified" them using programs like Photoshop and I had also the notion that images are just a combination of colors (like RGB), but I never expected to see that actually images are different layers of numbers that we can filter or modify to change what we see (now in hindsight, feels so obvious haha). Now I think I'll always see them in a whole new way!

Now moving on to this weeks' entry topic, I think the main takeaway this week is that there’s no single "best" sensor and it all depends on what you’re researching. Before this lecture I would think that Sentinel is definitely better than Landsat because of its different resolutions and uses, but actually after checking some applications I realized Landsat is still super relevant and is now making me think for what other applications it may be better too (maybe long term analysis because Landsat has more time in the market?). Overall, now I know that before picking a sensor, it’s worth thinking about what kind of info I actually need and which sensor is more useful for that specific application, and for that, looking examples of previous research is a great tool!
