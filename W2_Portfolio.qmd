title: "Portfolio tools: Xaringan and Quarto"

This week we explored how tools like Xaringan and Quarto can be used to have reproducible presentations and documents, useful for data science projects. As an exercise, I have developed this book using Quarto and a presentation on the Sentinel -2 satellite using Xaringan, which you can see here:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#Insert presentation

xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(url = "https://fiorellaguillen.github.io/CASA023-W2-PRESENTATION/", ratio = "16:9")
```

As a reflection on this exercise, I found that learning how to use these tools, specially Xaringan, was quite challenging, and probably not the best option for a simple presentation, but could be really useful when used to display code or data through tables for example, or when using some of the interactive tools that XaringanExtra has.
