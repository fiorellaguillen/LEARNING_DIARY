## **Summary**

In order to move forward on more advanced topics, I considered useful to have a brief overview of main terminology used in Earth Observation mentioned during this week's lecture.

First, I want to explain the difference between **1. Irradiance** and **2. Radiance.** The first one, refers to any radiation reaching the Earth from the Sun. The second one, refers to any radiation leaving the Earth towards the satellite.
