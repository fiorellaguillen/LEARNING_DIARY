## **Summary**

The *Plan Integral de Reconstrucción con Cambios* (PIRCC) is a strategy developed by the Peruvian government to rebuild and strengthen areas affected by *El Niño Costero*. Its goal is not just to repair damaged infrastructure but also to make communities more resilient against future disasters. The plan promotes sustainable urban development and better risk management, recognizing that prevention is more effective than post-disaster reconstruction. Also, given the increasing impact of climate change, the PIRCC highlights the need to prepare for extreme weather events rather than just reacting to them.

That said, while the plan includes prevention measures, these have mostly focused on building flood defenses, dikes, and urban development plans for affected cities, but is missing a set of tools to better inform the location of these projects from a data-driven approach, and that overall, allow long-term risk monitoring, including tools that could provide real-time data and analysis to guide urban planning and infrastructure decisions. Without that, rebuilding efforts might not be too strategic, and could have less accuracy, reducing that way its effectiveness to prevent future natural phenomena.

## **Applications**

Considering this, and in order to assist with contributing to PIRCC's policies goals, I consider it would be relevant to create a monitoring tool using Landsat imagery(because of its long-term data) that can analyse previous years' affected areas by El Niño and with that information classify land risk. These data can be used to identify regions with repeated flooding, land degradation, and other vulnerability factors that are indicative of high-risk areas.

For that, spectral indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) could be used to assess land cover changes and urban expansion, helping to identify areas where improvements are most needed.

With this application, we could shift towards a more data-driven approach to disaster prevention that could be replicated in different areas affected by this phenomenon, and ultimately, helps better inform policies to maximize its effects.

## **Reflections**

Through this brief, I could understand how to link what we are learning on Earth Observation, to planning urban development, which is related to my background as an urban planner. Also, having a critical analysis of the policy, it made me realize that they are lacking some important data that could improve its effectiveness.

Through the application, I consider satellite imagery can be leveraged to address specific challenges posed by El Niño, and can better anticipate future risks, making the PIRCC more effective and sustainable in the long term.

Additionally, through this exercise, I’ve recognized the importance of collaboration between different data sources, such as satellite imagery and ground-level assessments, to create a comprehensive view of the situation. Also, it’s clear that while remote sensing can provide invaluable insights, it must be combined with local knowledge and community engagement to ensure that the data is used effectively in shaping policies and practices on the ground.
