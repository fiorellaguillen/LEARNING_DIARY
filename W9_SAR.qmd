## **Summary**

**WEEK 9 Notes, yet to be organized:**

C band is the most useful SAR band. Long enough that is not noisy

SAR is seeing at 45Â° intead of having a huge antenaa(which means higher resolution), it receives images as moving, gaining distance and resolution

scattering mechanism: the way that objects reflect

rough scattering: chaotic, Sentinel 1 VV band

we only have access to VH and VV

X band is very easy to scatter, it just bounces and generates a rough surface C band penetrates leaves and shows branchs, generates volumes L band and P band can penetrate through branches and generate double bounde

VV is good for surface roughness

2 MODIS: Terra and Aqua
