## **Summary**

SAR is an active sensor. It is kind of like a bat. It emits a chirp and listens to the reflected signal

Compared to optical images, this one is B&W because it only goes from low to high values of the amplitude of the signal that was emmited by the sensor that has been reflected and reached by the sensor. its the only information giving us, textural not spectral

It has multiple bands, each one being the result of different frequencies of microwaves. Some are longer(that penentrate through thin canopies and atmospheric occlusions like clouds, but lower resolution)

C band is the most useful SAR band, the most used in active remote sensing (e.g. Sentinel 1). Short enough that the resolution is good but Long enough that is not super sensitive to interferences

SAR is seeing at 45Â° and its in orbit, its moving.

Sintetic aperture: synthetic antenna. the motion of the sensor is used to create a synthetic anthena

intead of having a huge antenaa(which means higher resolution), it receives images as moving, gaining distance and resolution

SAR has different polarizations: orientations of the plane in which the waves move.

Objects have scattering mechanism: the way that objects reflects the radar signal

Scattering mechanisms are a really important dimension in SAR, analogous to the color of images in optical imagery

Types:

rough surface scattering: chaotic mechanism. Signal goes in many directions. Very visible in VV polarization

Volume scattering: middle ground, for middle sized objects. Band called VH

Double bounce scattering: generated by buildings or vertical structures. Mostly sensitive in HH polarization

we only have access to VH and VV in Sentinal 1

X band is very easy to scatter, it just bounces and generates a rough surface C band penetrates leaves and shows branchs, generates volume scattering. L band and P band can penetrate through branches and generate double bounce scattering

The types of information we get from SAR sensor are amplitude or backscatter and phase

Amplitude: the loudness of the signal

Phase: at what point in the wave cycle we receive the reflected signal back to us. allows us to see distance to the ground and changes over time of it.(not available in GEE)

SAR Imagery in GEE is preprocessed, corrected for terrain.

SAR is a bit less useful for classification, but useful to identify different changes. Useful for change detections as its more consistent than optical imagery.

To identify changes we can substact two images from each other and see the changes, but if its an area in constant change like stations or construction sites, its not useful.

To identify anomalous changes, Ollie has a paper using SAR to analyse building damage detection. It uses info on variance, evaluates the standar deviation of each pixel before and after the war and shows the difference in the average backscatter outside of the bounds of the normal variation. So identifies changes anomalous, out of the normal pattern of noisiness/change.

He also finds that is useful to disaggregate orbital trajectories (ascending and discending) to ensure consistency, as well as different polarisations by a t-test of each one.

This option outperforms deep learning on optical imagery as deep learning is not as accuracte on not trained data, which isnt available when analysing war effects. Instead this statistical change detection methos is better, more accurate for each case without trained data,

## **Applications**

## **Reflections**

This week was also cool. We saw SAR and it was a whole differente range of options that optimal imagery doesn have. Also it was interesting to see the application that Ollie showed as it alligns with what i reflected on some weeks ago, when i was discussing about the fact that sometimes more advanced methods , in this case Deep Learning, are not necessarily the most useful ones and its actually better to really understand what are all the possibilities each option bring us and evaluate which makes more sense for each case depending on the available data and expected outputs.

SAR is something I havent heard before coming to UCL and its cool to be learning more and more each week, specially coming from such experts that make this complex topics seem easy to understand. Also after trying the practical I found it really interesting to replicate all the knowledge that Ollie has created for assessing this kind of issues. I keep wondering how else could this be used. I have previously analysed the changes of rivers over time and I found that they have stationality where they get fuller and emptier and it would be interesting to analyse it with EO using SAR but as far as i understood I would need to use the Phase for that, which is not available on GEE.
