    "text": "Introduction\nHello world!\nThis Learning Diary is part of the CASA0023 module, Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments, which I’m taking as part of the MSc Urban Spatial Science at UCL. Here, you’ll find weekly entries summarizing key takeaways from each lecture, examples of practical applications, and my personal reflections.\nBut first, let me introduce myself!\nMy name is Fiorella, and I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Urban Spatial Science. Back in 2021, I graduated as an architect and urbanist in Peru. Since then, I have developed a strong interest in sustainability, climate change, water resources, and urban settlements, particularly how these factors affect urban and natural environments. As an example, during my undergraduate thesis, I focused on assessing changes in a river in the Peruvian Amazon, accelerated by climate change, and proposed solutions to the urban challenges that emerged from these changes.\nSince graduating, I have worked in the public sector, contributing to Lima’s Rimac River renaturalization project. This role involved urban analysis, master planning, urban design, and policy implementation, with a strong emphasis on risk prevention, and nature-based solutions.\nWhile I have some basic experience using Earth Observation (EO) and remote sensing to address topics like those mentioned above, my approach has been largely empirical. That’s why I find this module to be an exciting opportunity to deepen my knowledge of these tools and processes, enabling me to better inform policies and urban solutions in future projects or research.\nI am particularly interested in how these technologies can be applied to urban challenges in the Global South, where they are often underutilized due to knowledge gaps. That’s why, throughout this diary, my reflections will aim to connect these tools to my background and interests, as well as explore their real-world applications in contexts similar to my country’s.\nAnd if you are curious about my previous projects, here you can have a glimpse at them!",

    "text": "2.1 Summary\nThis week’s lecture covered the basics of Earth Observation (EO) and Remote Sensing including topics such as definitions, relevance and terminology of Earth Observation, as well as more technical concepts to describe sensors (resolutions, types, interactions of light). In this summary, I’ll focus on the latter, mainly defining some of the key characteristics of sensors (Image 1). To have a clearer understanding of these concepts, I will exemplify them with information from two of the main satellites discussed in class: Landsat and Sentinel (Image 2).\nImage 1: Mind map of main characteristics of sensors\nImage 2: Mind map comparing main characteristics of two of the main sensors: Landsat and Sentinel\nFrom this comparison, it’s worth noticing that overall, Sentinel shows better characteristics, like spatial resolutions with more detail, more spectral bands and more frequent temporal resolution than Landsat. It would be interesting to see in which cases, despite having seemingly lower characteristics, Landsat imagery could represent a better tool to assess an spatial problem.",

    "text": "This week we explored how tools like Xaringan and Quarto can be used to have reproducible presentations and documents, useful for data science projects. As an exercise, I have developed this book using Quarto and a presentation on the Sentinel -2 satellite using Xaringan, which you can see here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reflection on this exercise, I found that learning how to use these tools, specially Xaringan, was quite challenging, and probably not the best option for a simple presentation, but could be really useful when used to display code or data through tables for example, or when using some of the interactive tools that XaringanExtra has.",

    "text": "2.2 Applications\nSince this week’s summary included a comparison between Landsat and Sentinel sensors, I considered relevant to read a paper that compares both satellites’ imagery applied to analyse Burn Severity Mapping in Western North America. This paper by Howe et al (2022) analysed 26 fires in western North America, and found that “Sentinel generally performed as well or better than Landsat for four spectral indices of burn severity”, also that Sentinel’s finer spatial resolution helps to identify fine-scale fire effects and therefore has a more precise identification of spatial patterns of fires and burned areas.\nOn the other hand, the paper “Analysis of urban heat islands with Landsat satellite images and GIS in Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan City” (Kasniza et al., 2023) explored the evolution of heat islands and their relationship to land surface temperature in Kuala Lumpur using Landsat 8 imagery. Instead of focusing on the research details, I want to focus on the methodology, where they explained that Landsat 8 was chosen because it provides thermal data through Band 10: Thermal Infrared (which isn’t available on Sentinel). This band was used alongside other bands like NDVI and NIR for the analysis.",

    "text": "2.3 Reflections\nAfter reviewing the main concepts of sensors and comparing Landsat and Sentinel satellites, it seemed that Sentinel has more advantages in terms of its various resolutions and some uses like burn mapping. However, after reviewing literature and considering the pros and cons of each, it’s worth pointing out that Landsat is still highly relevant, especially to certain topics, for example when it comes to analyzing heat, thanks to its thermal bands. Also, since Sentinel is relatively new, if I were looking to analyze long-term trends, Landsat would probably be the best option, which is something to keep in mind for future projects. In general, the main reflection from this, would be that depending of the research we want to do, it’s worth assessing which sensor would give us greater information, and looking for examples in previous research is a great tool for that.",

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nThe Plan Integral de Reconstrucción con Cambios (PIRCC) is a strategy developed by the peruvian government to rebuild and strengthen areas affected by El Niño Costero. Its goal is not just to repair damaged infrastructure but also to make communities more resilient against future disasters. The plan promotes sustainable urban development and better risk management, recognizing that prevention is more effective than post-disaster reconstruction. Also, given the increasing impact of climate change, the PIRCC highlights the need to prepare for extreme weather events rather than just reacting to them.\nThat said, while the plan includes prevention measures, these have mostly focused on building flood defenses, dikes, and urban development plans for affected cities, but is missing a set of tools to better inform the location of these projects from a data-driven approach, and that overall, allow long-term risk monitoring, including tools that could provide real-time data and analysis to guide urban planning and infrastructure decisions. Without that, rebuilding efforts might not be too strategic, and could have less accuracy, reducing that way its effectiveness to prevent future natural phenomena.",

    "text": "5.2 Applications\nConsidering this, and in order to assist with contributing to PIRCC’s policies goals, I consider it would be relevant to create a monitoring tool using Landsat imagery(because of its long-term data) that can analyse previous years’ affected areas by El Niño and with that information classify land risk. These data can be used to identify regions with repeated flooding, land degradation, and other vulnerability factors that are indicative of high-risk areas.\nFor that, spectral indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) could be used to assess land cover changes and urban expansion, helping to identify areas where improvements are most needed.\nWith this application, we could shift towards a more data-driven approach to disaster prevention that could be replicated in different areas affected by this phenomenon, and ultimately, helps better inform policies to maximize its effects.",

Also, having a critical analysis of the policy, it made me realize that they are lacking some important data that could improve its effectiveness.\nThrough the application, I consider satellite imagery can be leveraged to address specific challenges posed by El Niño, and can better anticipate future risks, making the PIRCC more effective and sustainable in the long term.\nAdditionally, through this exercise, I’ve recognized the importance of collaboration between different data sources, such as satellite imagery and ground-level assessments, to create a comprehensive view of the situation. Also, it’s clear that while remote sensing can provide invaluable insights, it must be combined with local knowledge and community engagement to ensure that the data is used effectively in shaping policies and practices on the ground.",
