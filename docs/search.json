    "text": "Introduction\nHello world!\nThis Learning Diary is part of the CASA0023 module, Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments, which I’m taking as part of the MSc Urban Spatial Science at UCL. Here, you’ll find weekly entries summarizing key takeaways from each lecture, examples of practical applications, and my personal reflections.\nBut first, let me introduce myself!\nMy name is Fiorella, and I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Urban Spatial Science. Back in 2021, I graduated as an architect and urbanist in Peru. Since then, I have developed a strong interest in sustainability, climate change, water resources, and urban settlements, particularly how these factors affect urban and natural environments. As an example, during my undergraduate thesis, I focused on assessing changes in a river in the Peruvian Amazon, accelerated by climate change, and proposed solutions to the urban challenges that emerged from these changes.\nSince graduating, I have worked in the public sector, contributing to Lima’s Rimac River renaturalization project. This role involved urban analysis, master planning, urban design, and policy implementation, with a strong emphasis on risk prevention, and nature-based solutions.\nWhile I have some basic experience using Earth Observation (EO) and remote sensing to address topics like those mentioned above, my approach has been largely empirical. That’s why I find this module to be an exciting opportunity to deepen my knowledge of these tools and processes, enabling me to better inform policies and urban solutions in future projects or research.\nI am particularly interested in how these technologies can be applied to urban challenges in the Global South, where they are often underutilized due to knowledge gaps. That’s why, throughout this diary, my reflections will aim to connect these tools to my background and interests, as well as explore their real-world applications in contexts similar to my country’s.\nAnd if you are curious about my previous projects, here you can have a glimpse at them!",

    "text": "This week we explored how tools like Xaringan and Quarto can be used to have reproducible presentations and documents, useful for data science projects. As an exercise, I have developed this book using Quarto and a presentation on the Sentinel -2 satellite using Xaringan, which you can see here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reflection on this exercise, I found that learning how to use these tools, specially Xaringan, was quite challenging, and probably not the best option for a simple presentation, but could be really useful when used to display code or data through tables for example, or when using some of the interactive tools that XaringanExtra has.",

From all the contents of the class, I will focus, on this summary, on the differences between two main sensors: Landsat and Sentinel. This comparison will draw on some of the contents of the lecture, like types of sensors, resolutions, spectral bands, and applications.\n*Pending to upload mind map",

    "text": "3.2 Applications\nConsidering that this week’s summary was focused on comparing Landsat and Sentinel sensors, I found appropriate to dedicate a part of this sub chapter to a paper that compares both’s imagery applied to analyse Burn Severity Mapping in Western North America. This paper by Howe et al (2022) analysed 26 fires in western North America, and found that “Sentinel generally performed as well or better than Landsat for four spectral indices of burn severity”, also that Sentinel’s finer spatial resolution helps to identify fine-scale fire effects and therefore have a more precise identification of spatial patterns of fires and burned areas.",
