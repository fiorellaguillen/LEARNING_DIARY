  abstract = {India had announced the longest ever lockdown from 25 March 2020 to 14 April 2020 amid COVID-19 pandemic. It was reported that the water quality of the Ganga River has improved as compared to regular during this country-wide lockdown. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the change in water quality of the river in terms of turbidity purely through remote sensing data, in the absence of ground observations, especially during this time period. The change in spectral reflectance of water along the river in the visible region has been analyzed using the Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing data at Haridwar, Kanpur, Prayagraj, and Varanasi stretches of the river. In the present study, it was found that the red and NIR bands are most sensitive, and can be used to estimate the turbidity. Further, the temporal variation in turbidity was also analyzed through normalized difference turbidity index at each location. It was observed that the turbidity in the river has reduced drastically at each stretch of the river. The study elicited that the remote sensing approach can be used to make qualitative estimates on turbidity, even in the absence of field observations.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of burn severity is a critical need for an improved understanding of fire behavior and ecology and effective post-fire management. Although NASA Landsat satellites have a long history of use for remotely sensed mapping of burn severity, the recently launched (2015 and 2017) European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite constellation offers increased temporal and spatial resolution with global coverage, combined with free data access. Evaluations of burn severity derived from Landsat and Sentinel generally show comparable results, but these studies only assessed a small number of fires with limited field data. We used 912 ground calibration plots from 26 fires that burned between 2016 and 2019 in western North America to compare Sentinel- and Landsat-derived burn severity estimates with the field-based composite burn index. We mapped burn severity using two methods; the well-established paired scene approach, in which a single pre- and post-fire scene are selected for each fire, and also a mean image compositing approach that automatically integrates multiple scenes using the cloud-based remote sensing platform Google Earth Engine. We found that Sentinel generally performed as well or better than Landsat for four spectral indices of burn severity, particularly when using atmospherically corrected Sentinel imagery. Additionally, we tested the effects of mapping burn severity at Sentinel's finer spatial resolution (10 m) on estimates of the spatial complexity of stand-replacing fire, resulting in a 5\% average reduction per-fire in area mapped as high-severity patch interiors (24,273 ha total) compared to mapping at the resolution of Landsat (30 m). These findings suggest Sentinel may improve ecological discrimination of fine-scale fire effects, but also warrant caution when comparing estimates of burn severity spatial patterns derived at different resolutions. Overall, these results indicate that burn severity mapping will benefit substantially from the integration of Sentinel imagery through increased imagery availability, and that Sentinel's higher spatial resolution improves opportunities for examining finer-scale fire effects across ecosystems.},

  abstract = {We propose a combination of methods for processing multitemporal multispectral satellite images to identify variations in vegetation indices for fixed regions across time to analyze deforestation in Peru. The images, taken from a location in Ucayali, Peru, are obtained from public repositories for Sentinel-2 satellite, which covers up to 13 spectral band layers with spatial resolutions of 10, 20, and 60 m and have a temporal resolution of 5~days with the same angle vision. We preprocessed the images for cloud and river removal and normalization to apply the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). All images were segmented with their corresponding model, leading to the analysis of the variance of this segmentation information across different time frames for a single location in which the normalized difference of time series (NDTS) was obtained for each year. Finally, a first approach was built for a linear regression model that could segment each frame into sectors, according to vegetation density, using the multispectral features as parameters. For the selected location, the results show an increment from about 4200 ha in 2018 to about 8200 in 2020.},
